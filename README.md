# This was a project done in collaboration with Austin Lively and David Fantin.

# My contributions to this project included:
  - A multi-threaded LU decomposition algorithm for calculating determinants for NxN matrices.
  - A multi-threaded ant colony optimization algorithm for solving the traveling salesperson problem

# Libraries used:
  - OpenMP
  - MPI
